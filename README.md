# Questions
## To Ask

## Asked
 - [x] Do the colors of the edges matter?
   - Nope! 
   - [ ] What about arrows on both sides of an edge
 - [x] How is the input-file structured?
   - How ever we'd like
   - He plans on testing it by asking us to add another edge somewhere at random
 - [x] What does the number on the graph in the document mean?
   - [x] Are these numbers weighted?
       - They will be later but for now, we ignore the weights
    - The same graph is to be used in a future project. We only care about the indices of nodes and their connections to other nodes
 - [x] What does a properly formatted log file look like
    - It is up to us. It just has to be readable.
 - [x] What functions are considered algorithms?
   - Pretty much everything in the whitelisted libraries is alright. Just no obscure sort functions, etc.
 - [x] What does overall runtime mean
   - Sum of the individual searches - do not include file i/o
